## minimap
The minimap sample shows how to have objective-like markers on an elliptical minimap. The markers should indicate the position of the objective within the minimap (ellipse) without leaving the bounds of the ellipse.
You can simulate the objective location by moving the mouse around the view - the marker should follow the mouse but not leave the minimap.
